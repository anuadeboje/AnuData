# AnuData

The goal of this project was to identify new Beyond Meat regions by leveraging demographic and
Google Trends data of the regions where demand for Beyond meat products is established.
Furthermore, this project hoped to demonstrate that a data science methodology, clustering,
would result in a Beyond Meat City/Region cluster or profile that would aid in targeted marketing
campaigns and supply chain optimization
